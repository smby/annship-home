            <div className="context-text">
              A. It is WARRANTED by the Insured that all parcels under this coverage will be shipped in strict accordance with all regulations of the carrier and amendments thereof.
              <br/>B. THE UNDERWRITERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE for any loss or damage to property covered by other valid and collectible Insurance nor for carrier’s liability. Coverage shall be for EXCESS of aforementioned. COVERAGE CONTINGENT upon Insured being reimbursed by the carrier for carrier’s liability. Payment from the carrier does not guarantee approval of claim.
              <br/>C. The DEDUCTIBLE, if any, shall be deducted from the amount of the claim or Liability Limit, whichever is less, on a “per parcel” basis and borne by the Insured. The Insured shall be responsible for (and entitled to) collecting any amount for which the carrier may be liable.
              <br/>D. Failure to insure the total value of your goods on each shipment will result in a co-insurance penalty; i.e., we will not pay a greater proportion of loss than the values you reported divided by the actual values of the goods.
              <br/>E. In the case that the Insured (AnnShip user) acts as their own claim reporting agent, the Insured will need to file notice of non-delivery or damage with the carrier (FedEx, UPS) within the carrier’s claim reporting period, but in no event shall such notification exceed fourteen (14) days from date Insured had knowledge of said non-delivery or damage. All claims are to be submitted to AnnShip within fourteen (14) days from the date on the carrier’s check. The Insured will submit a completed AnnShip claim form, proof of carrier payment, copy of carrier tracer form showing L.D.I. or other identifying number, copy from original invoice to consignee, whichever of the aforementioned is applicable, and any additional documentation requested to substantiate loss. Handling fees and insurance fees are excluded from coverage. All damaged property for which payment (not repair costs), or replacement has been made, must, on request be returned to Underwriters. Failure to hold the damaged property until the claim has reached a resolution will result in the denial of the claim. In the case that AnnShip acts as the claim reporting agent on behalf of the Insured (AnnShip user), the Insured is to submit a completed AnnShip claim form, proof of value, and any other relevant documentation requested to substantiate loss. Handling fees and insurance fees are excluded from coverage. All damaged property for which payment (not repair costs), or replacement has been made, must, on request be returned to Underwriters. Failure to hold the damaged property until the claim has reached a resolution will result in the denial of the claim.
              <br/>F. The Insured must file notice of non-delivery or damage with AnnShip within thirty (30) days from date of shipment for United States Post Office shipments. There is a twenty-one (21) day waiting period before the Insured may file a notice of non-delivery to AnnShip for packages shipped domestic via the United States Post Office. No claims will be honored if filed after the 30 day expiration period. The Insured will submit completed AnnShip claim form, copy of the original invoice to the consignee, signed and dated statement from the consignee, proof of damage if applicable and any additional documentation requested to substantiate loss. Shipping costs must be included in the declared value in order to be paid with claim. Handling fees and insurance fees are excluded from coverage. All damaged property for which payment (not repair costs) or replacement has been made, must, on request be returned to Underwriters. Failure to hold the damaged property until the claim has reached a resolution will result in the denial of the claim.
              <br/>G. The Insured will have one (1) year from the date of shipment to provide any required and/or additional documentation which has been requested of the Insured to substantiate said claim. Failure to provide the required and/or additional documentation within one (1) year from the ship date will result in the denial of the claim.
              <br/>H. Any covered loss will be promptly paid to the Insured or his Assignee after notice of loss or damage and required documentation has been received and accepted by Underwriters in accordance with the terms and conditions of this coverage, unless property is replaced, at the option of Underwriters, with like kind, function, and quality.
              <br/>I. Upon payment or replacement for loss or damage, the Underwriters shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the Insured including whatever money may be recoverable, but excluding any deductible amounts applied to any claim settlement on account of said loss or damage from the carrier, or any of its officers or agents, or from any other person or corporation whatsoever. The Insured specifically covenants and agrees to assist the Company in every possible manner to secure reimbursement of said loss or damage. In the event the carrier admits to fraudulent activity from carrier employee’s, the insured will take action against the carrier and not hold AnnShip responsible for claims associated.
              <br/>J. No suit or action or proceedings for the recovery of any claim under this Coverage shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless the same is commenced within twelve (12) months after discovery by the Insured of the occurrence which gives rise to the claim, provided however, that if by the laws of the State within which this Coverage is issued such limitation is invalid, then any such claim shall be void unless such action, suit or proceeding be commenced within the shortest limit to time permitted by the laws of such State to be fixed herein.
